Below we provide some background theory relevant to using equadratures.


Fundamentals
""""""""""""

The three key fundamental building blocks in equadratures are classes by the names of *Parameter*, *Basis* and *Polynomial*. In this section we detail their mathematical definitions and the role their namesake classes play in equadratures.
