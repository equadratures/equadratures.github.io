About
=============

``equadratures`` is first and foremost a scientific organisation with a global footprint. We are proud to make freely available the various modules and codes we develop, and see their use across a range of data science problems.

.. rubric:: Acknowledgments

``equadratures`` has been supported by numerous grants; it was founded through an `Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) <https://epsrc.ukri.org/>`_ Knowledge Transfer Fellowship (KTF) from the Department of Engineering at the `University of Cambridge <https://www.cam.ac.uk/>`_ in 2016. Since 2018, the project has been supported by Wave 1 of The UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund under the EPSRC Grant EP/T001569/1, particularly the Digital twins for aeronautics theme within that grant, and by the `Lloydâ€™s Register Foundation-Alan Turing Institute programme on Data-Centric Engineering <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering>`_ under the LRF grant G0095. The project is also grateful to the financial support of `Jesus College Cambridge <https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/>`__ and the `Cambridge Trusts <https://www.cambridgetrust.org/>`__.

``equadratures`` is proudly a `NumFocus <https://numfocus.org/>`__ affiliate organisation and has benefitted from their stewardship of open-source science and code. It has also been a mentoring organisation for the `Google summer of code program <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`__ in 2020 and 2021.
